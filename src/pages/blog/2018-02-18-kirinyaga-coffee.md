‘Kianjege’ is a Kikuyu word meaning Porcupine. Southwest of Mt. Kenya, this area is famous for arrow-root and the native porcupines who consume it. Nearby are beautiful valleys in the Kirinyaga District dotted with small farms growing coffee and tea. Each of our coffees is named after the local mill which processes coffee from dozens of nano farmers. The coffee is then sold directly to us by the Kibirigwi co-op.LYP, Ltd. 2017 www.golyp.com 

During harvest our coffee is washed with fresh water from the Ragati River. The Mt. Kenya region is unique for its combined proximity to the equator, rich volcanic soil and average growing elevation of 1600 meters above sea level.Small farmer processing facilities like the Kianjege Co-op are set up in order to facilitate 500-1000+ small farmers who bring their coffee cherry for processing.LYP, Ltd. 2017 www.golyp.com 

Our SPOT coffees are currently stored in Spokane WA and Portland OR.LYP, Ltd. 2017 www.golyp.com
