## Site Purpose

Coffee Offering is currently building an inventory of unique coffees in order to promote new origins, facilitate market access for suppliers and overall simplify the search process for coffee buyers.

This site is under construction, but we published this beta list of SPOT coffees for the 2018 Specialty Coffee Expo.

## Origin Access

Due to forces of nature and economics, viable coffee growing regions are expanding, creating opportunity for _new_ origins, new producers, and new coffees. Due to the rise of the specialty industry, places which have not grown coffee for 100 years or more are now able to.\
The following practices are encouraged:

* Recognition of new growing regions and producers
* Increased production and visibility offerings
* Trade acceleration via information sharing
* Streamlining coffee distribution by listing your offering on CoffeeOffering.com
