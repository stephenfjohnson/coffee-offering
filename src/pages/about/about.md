title: About Coffee Offering

Coffee Offering is an inventory of coffees from all corners of the globe. We partner with and promote new suppliers, create market access and streamline the search for coffee buyers.

Our current beta list of 4 SPOT coffees is published for the 2018 Specialty Coffee Expo. Please fill out the contact form to list your coffee with us.

## Origin Access

Due to forces of nature and economics, viable coffee growing regions are expanding, creating opportunity for new origins, new producers, and new coffees. Rising demand, the specialty market and advanced agricultural technology enables places which have never grown coffee to now do so.\
The following practices are encouraged:

* Recognition of new growing regions and producers
* Increased production and visibility offerings
* Trade acceleration via information sharing
* Streamlining coffee distribution by listing your offering on CoffeeOffering.com
