  Varietal: Chinese Catimor

  Score: 93

  Cup Notes: A light-medium roast opens up this consistently balanced terroir.
  Warm butter and pine sap fragrance turns to a milk chocolate aroma. First sip
  - immediately the savory pepper (typical of Chinese Catimors) opens up, a
  mellow spice which mingles with the soft orange citrus and then, caramel (no,
  not salted.) Unlike many catimors, the acidity and "spicyness" play together
  in this cup, revealing a delicate brown sugar sweetness. Bottom of the cup,
  room temperature, and the sweetness and spice have left a bit of green tea.
  Flexible, dynamic, complex yet mellow.
