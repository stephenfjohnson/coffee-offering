  Varietal: Chinese Catimor

  Score: 93

  Cup Notes: A light-medium roast opens up this consistently balanced terroir.
  Warm butter and pine sap fragrance turns to a milk chocolate aroma. First sip
  - immediately the savory pepper (typical of Chinese Catimors) opens up, a
  mellow spice which mingles with the soft orange citrus and then, caramel (no,
  not salted.) Unlike many catimors, the acidity and "spicyness" play together
  in this cup, revealing a delicate brown sugar sweetness. Bottom of the cup,
  room temperature, and the matrix has left a bit of green tea. Flexible,
  dynamic, complex yet mellow.

FULL WASHED: After picking, fresh cherry is delivered to the mill where it is weighed and pickers are paid accordingly. It is then dropped into the syphon tank where fresh mountain spring water rinses the cherries before the are sent through the depulping machine and deposited into fermentation tanks for 30 hours. After fermenting evenly, the parchment beans are run through the washing channels to be “floated” which means that the lighter, less dense beans flow first and the last, most dense beans are sorted last. At the bottom of the wet mill channels the beans are rinsed one more time before being spread out  on raised “African” drying beds to dry for up to 15 days until optimal 12% moisture content has been achieved.
