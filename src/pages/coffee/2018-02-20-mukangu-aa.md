The Mukangu AA coffee was personally sourced and directly imported from the Kibirigwi Coop in the Kirinyaga region of Kenya. It is named after the local Mukangu wet mill which sources coffee from dozens of nano-farmers in the surrounding vicinity who's offering is exported by the coop.

This coffee is hand picked from fertile volcanic soil at 1600m before undergoing a full-washed process. The importer hopes to be part of encouraging local organic initiatives. For now it is an example of some of the best bourbon SL-28 and SL-34 lots coming from this region!
