‘Kianjege’ is a Kikuyu word meaning Porcupine. Southwest of Mt. Kenya, this area is famous for arrow-root and the native porcupines who consume it.

Nearby are beautiful valleys in the Kirinyaga District dotted with small farms growing coffee and tea. This coffee is named after the local Kianjege wet mill which buys cherry from dozens of very small farmers in the surrounding vicinity before it is sold and exported by the co-op.

The Kianjege AA coffee is personally sourced and directly imported by LYP Ltd. from the Kibirigwi Co-op in the Kirinyaga region of Kenya. The fact that this coffee is SPOT in the U.S. is a testament to the importer's confidence in the future of the Kenyan coffee industry.

This coffee is hand picked from fertile volcanic soil at 1600m before undergoing a full-washed process. LYP intends to be part of encouraging local organic initiatives. This coffee is an example of some of the best bourbon SL-28 and SL-34 beans coming from this region!
