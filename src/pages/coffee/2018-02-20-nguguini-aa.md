This Kenyan AA coffee was sourced and imported from the Kibirigwi Co-op in the Kirinyaga region of Kenya. It is named after the local mills which buy cherry from dozens of very small farmers in the surrounding vicinity before it is sold and exported by the co-op. The fact that this coffee is SPOT in the U.S. is a testament to the importer's confidence in the future of the Kenyan coffee industry.\
This coffee is hand picked from fertile volcanic soil at 1600m before undergoing a full-washed process.
