‘Kianjege’ is a Kikuyu word meaning Porcupine. Southwest of Mt. Kenya, this area is famous for arrow-root and the native porcupines who consume it. 

Nearby are beautiful valleys in the Kirinyaga District dotted with small farms growing coffee and tea. This coffee is named after the local Kianjege mill which processes coffee from dozens of nano farmers. The coffee is then directly traded to by the Kibirigwi co-op.

This coffee is hand picked from fertile volcanic soil at 1600m before undergoing a full-washed process. It is organic, but not certified due to supply structure. The importer hopes to be part of encouraging local organic initiatives.

It is an example of some of the best bourbon SL-28 and SL-34 lots coming from this region!
