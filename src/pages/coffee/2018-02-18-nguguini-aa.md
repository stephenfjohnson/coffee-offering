‘Kianjege’ is a Kikuyu word meaning Porcupine. Southwest of Mt. Kenya, this area is famous for arrow-root and the native porcupines who consume it. 

Nearby are beautiful valleys in the Kirinyaga District dotted with small farms growing coffee and tea. Each of our coffees is named after the local mill which processes coffee from dozens of nano farmers. The coffee is then sold directly to us by the Kibirigwi co-op.
